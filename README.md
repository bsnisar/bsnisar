## Bio

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m interested on a different aspects of ML and really inspired by recent decade of achivments in this area. Moreover, I am not afraid of this and believe that the open letter asking to suspend AI (https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/) simply shows fear at the moment of approaching the phase transition of society.  

ğŸŒ± I'm an adventurer by nature so tryes to follow interests.
